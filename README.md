# Nonogram Solver

This repository hosts a program to solve and verify solutions to [nonograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram).
I built this for my application to the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/).

#### Project Constraints

Constraints were imposed both by the Recurse Center and by myself.

- *Recurse*: Program fully independently.
- *Recurse*: Program from scratch (no frameworks).
- *Self*: Only dependent on Python 3.12.
  - 2D fixed-size arrays without `numpy` and testing without `pytest` were unfortunate results.
- *Self*: No large language models.
- *Self*: No research on existing nonogram solver algorithms.
  - The algorithm development is the fun part!
- *Self*: Two weeks of development.
