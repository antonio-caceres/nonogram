# Nonogram Solver

This repository hosts a program to solve and verify solutions to [nonograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram).

I built this from scratch for my application to the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/).
I chose not to use any third-party packages, and all the code is written without large language models.
